### PUE FAQs/Methodology

#### What is PUE?

PUE stands for power usage effectiveness.  First introduced by @greenGridPUE2007 in 2007, it is a common energy performance metric utilized by the data center industry.  PUE is calculated by dividing the total amount of energy consumed by a data center by the amount of energy consumed by its IT equipment alone. Lower values of PUE indicate that smaller shares of a data centerâ€™s energy use go to its non-IT infrastructure systems (such as cooling and power supply systems). The theoretical minimum value of PUE for any data center is 1.0.

#### Is PUE still relevant?

PUE only captures the shares of IT and non-IT energy used by a data center. Therefore, PUE shouldnâ€™t be interpreted as a stand-alone measure of a data centerâ€™s energy efficiency or sustainability [@masanetLowCarbon2013]. That said, PUE is still relevant to multiple stakeholders for several reasons:
- It is easy to measure for most data centers.
- When applied to a single data center, trends in PUE can be useful for understanding and tracking infrastructure energy efficiency.
- It is widely used by energy modelers to quantify the infrastructure system energy use of the data center sector.
- Even low PUE values translate into substantial grid loads at large data centers, giving value to its visibility.
- It is a simple metric that policy makers can use [@vertivBeijing2021] to incentivize or require energy-efficient infrastructure systems.
